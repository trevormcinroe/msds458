## Introduction
Contains all of my code that is relevant to Northwestern's MSDS-458 class, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning

## Summary
- Week 2:
    - Solving XOR problem with from-scratch implementation of DNN, Adam optimizer, and mini-batcher
- Week 3:
    - Observing hyperparameter choice and domain-specific data-denoising implications
- Week 5:
    - Observing training-stabilizing effects of batch norm and residual blocks in deep CNNs
- Week 7:
    - Training Siamese networks to estimate semantic similarity in sentence pairs
- Week 10:
    - Testing Hindsight Experience Replay on a variety of reinforcement learning problems with both DQN and DDPG
